# Smart Contract Repository for Data Referencing and Manipulation

Welcome to the Smart Contract Repository for Data Referencing and Manipulation. This repository contains a collection of smart contracts designed to facilitate data referencing, retrieval, querying, editing, and data verification tasks. These contracts can also be used to read the hex code of data segments running within the same entropy environment.

## Smart Contracts

### 1. DataReference.sol

- **Description**: This smart contract provides functions to reference and retrieve data stored on the blockchain.

- **Usage**: You can use this contract to securely reference and retrieve data from the blockchain by calling the `getReference` function.

### 2. DataManipulation.sol

- **Description**: This contract allows you to perform data manipulation operations like editing and querying data.

- **Usage**: Utilize the provided functions to query and edit data stored on the blockchain. 

### 3. DataVerification.sol

- **Description**: This smart contract offers data verification capabilities to ensure the integrity and authenticity of data.

- **Usage**: Use the functions within this contract to verify data integrity and authenticity.

### 4. HexCodeReader.sol

- **Description**: This contract can be used to read the hex code of a data segment running within the same entropy environment.

- **Usage**: Call the `readHexCode` function to read the hex code of a data segment.

## How to Use

### Using an IDE Workspace (Recommended)

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

Open your preferred blockchain development IDE (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat).

Import the smart contracts from the cloned repository into your IDE.

Compile and deploy the smart contracts to your desired blockchain network within the IDE.

Interact with the deployed contracts through the IDE's built-in interface, calling the functions as needed.

Using the Command Line (Not Recommended)
Please note that using the command line for interacting with smart contracts is not recommended due to potential security risks. However, if you choose to proceed:

Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone [repository_url]
Install the necessary development tools and libraries for your blockchain platform (e.g., Truffle, Hardhat).

Compile and deploy the smart contracts to your blockchain network using the command line.

Interact with the deployed contracts by crafting and sending transactions manually. Be cautious and ensure you follow security best practices.
